# Project description  
Given an array of numbers a1... aN, it is required to find the boundaries of its strictly monotone subsegment of maximum length. If there are several of them, display the boundaries of any.

Examples:
1. Input: `-3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8`  
output: `0.6`  
2. input: `-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1`  
output: `0, 0 (or other index: i, i)`
